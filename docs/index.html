                In the event that something seems to be broken, switch on debugging to help identify the problem. If you raise

                The Helvéczia system uses the Foundry VTT <em>Active Effects</em> to model the game mechanics
                of various class, peoples and skills, but it's possible to add effects directly to characters and any items.
                This can enable you to create your own custom effects. In the future, I'll wrap a more user-friendly
                interface over this, but for now, you can get to these effects by
                ticking this box. It will add a new tab (for the GM) to character and item sheets.

        <div>
          <p>When you create a new Character and give them a name, you will be presented with a clean character sheet.
            This defaults to the character starting at level 2 (with 2000 experience points) and a portrait (which you can change by clicking on it). 
            You also have a button to generate two sets of ability statistics, as per the rules, which you will get to choose one set of.

        <div>
          <p>
            Here, we want to make Pascal a student, so we choose option B as it has better intelligence,
          </p>
          <div style="text-align: center;">
            <img src="./images/choose-origins.png" />
          </div>
          <p>
            Once chosen, the abilities are displayed, plus the saving throws, and the ability bonuses. We then need to click the button to choose our origins and class.
          </p>
          <div style="text-align: center;">
            <img src="./images/choose-class.png" />
          </div>
          <p>
            We want to make Pascal French, and a student. Once chosen, the bonuses from the ethnic origin and class are applied. 
            We then need to click the die that will be flashing to generate initial hitpoints. Because we chose to be a student, we only get to roll a d6.

          <h4 class="docs-header" id="skills">Skills</h4>
          <p>The Skills tab shows what current skills the character has mastered, either by virtue of their origins or class, or what they have learned subsequently.</p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
            <img src="./images/choose-skills.png" />
          </p>
          <p>Because Pascal is a Student, he has already been assigned the Student skills of <em>Spells</em> and <em>Doctorate</em></p>
          <p>He is also allowed two randomly assigned <em> Science Skills</em> which you can click the button to generate.</p>
          <p>
           Once those are assigned, we still have 2 more skill slots to choose. We can get them from the <em>Skill Compendium</em> by clicking on the
           Compendium Packs sidebar tab, clicking on <em>Skills</em> and then dragging our choices from there onto our character sheet.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
            <img src="./images/skill-compendium.png" />
          </p>
          <p>Here, we have had Geometry and Anatomy assigned as our Science skills, and we have added two magical skills - Alchemy and Cryptography. </p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
            <img src="./images/chosen-skills.png" />
          </p>
          <p>A skill check can be made by hovering over the skill and clicking on the <em>D20</em> that appears.</p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
            <img src="./images/skill-check.png" />
          </p>
          <p>For all checks. you will be presented with a dialog giving you the chance to select the difficulty level of the check, and any situational modifiers that might apply.
            You only need to add anything specific to the situation, as all other modifiers due to level and ability will be automatically applied.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
            <img src="./images/skill-result.png" />
          </p>
          <p>The result will be displayed as a Chat Message. Here, poor Pascal failed his Alchemy check, despite having a total of +3 bonus to his roll!
          </p>
        </div>
        <hr>
        <h4 class="docs-header" id="possessions">Possessions</h4>
        <div class="row">
          <p style="text-align: center;">
            <img src="./images/possessions-tab.png" />
          </p>
          <p>
            The Possessions tab shows the articles of equipment, armour, weapons, etc. the character has, assigned to the columns of what is 
            <em>Worn</em>, <em>Carried</em> and available on their <em>Mount</em>, as per the rules.
          </p>
          <p>Pascal was given 7 Thalers on his generation, so this appears below, in the <em>Wealth</em> section.</p>
          
          <div class="row">
            <div class="four columns">
              <p>
                To add various weapons, armour and other possessions, simply open the relevant Compendium Pack and drag the item onto the character sheet. 
                Don't forget to make a note of the costs and deduct from your wealth manually.
               </p>
              <p>
              Here we have given Pascal a Fur Coat for protection (which has automatically increased his AC by +3 when dragged into the Worn column), and a Pistol as a weapon.
              </p>
              <p>
              We have also dragged a default starting Spell Book for him.
              </p>
              <p>We have updated his Wealth to reflect these expenses.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="eight columns">
              <img src="./images/worn-items.png" />

            <img src="./images/combat-tab.png" />
          </p>
          <p>
            Now we have a weapon, it is worth looking at the Combat tab. Only weapons that are in the <em>Worn</em> column on the Possessions tab will appear here.
          </p>
          <p>By default there is always one's Fists, so an unarmed combat entry also appears here.</p>
          <p>
            By clicking on an item, a summary of that item will appear. Here we can see the various details of a pistol: It is <code>Ranged</code>, 
            has an Attack bonus of <code>+2</code>, does the significant damage of <code>1d10X</code> (meaning 10's explode for another roll),
             a critical is scored on a natural roll of <code>20</code>, and would do <code>X3</code> (triple) damage in that event.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="six columns">
            <p>To attack with his pistol, you can click on the <em>D20</em> that appears when you hover on the weapon.</p>
            <p>You will be presented with a check dialog as usual. If you have an enemy targeted already (click and press <code>T</code> on their Token) 
              then their AC will automatically be used as the target for the roll.</p>
            <p>If the roll is successful, then damage will automatically be rolled.</p>
            <p>Here it seems Pascal scored a hit, but not a critical success.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="six columns">

          </div>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>If a natural roll of the weapons critical range is rolled, then a <em>potential crit</em> has occurred, and the roll message
             will give the attacker a button to press to see if a crit really has occured. If it has, then the damage with the multiplier is then rolled.</p>
             <p style="text-align: center;">
              <img src="./images/potential-crit.png" />
              <img src="./images/crit-scored.png" />
            </p>
            <p>As per the rules, if another natural crit is rolled, this means instant death, and an appropriate message would be displayed!</p>
        </div>
        <hr>
        <h4 class="docs-header" id="class">Class</h4>
        <div class="row">
          <p style="text-align: center;">
            <img src="./images/student-tab.png" />
          </p>
          <p>Since Pascal is a Student, a <em>Student</em> tab is present. This tab would be display the respective class details for whichever class
            the character has chosen.
          </p>
          <p>Each class tab shows a description of the class, and any specialisms chosen. Both Students and Clerics have spells as a specialism, 
            so this tab also shows the list of spells that Pascal has memorized.
          </p>
          <p>For each spell level, there is a section, with a header that shows:
            <ol>
              <li>current number of spells memorized,</li>
              <li>maximum number of spells that can be memorized,</li>
              <li>how many of those are <em>bonus</em> spells, which can be retained and rememorized.</li>
            </ol>
          </p>
          <p>For Clerics, you would randomly roll for your list of starting spells and then drag each of them from their respective Compendium pack.</p> 
          <p>However, for Students, they start with a random selection in a Spellbook. A starting Spellbook is provided as an example, 
            but you should edit the list in the one provided by dragging them onto the description of the book:
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
            <img src="./images/spellbook.png" />
          </p>
          <p>
            Once you have a spellbook populated, you can drag that onto your character sheet and it will appear in their possessions. 
            To then memorize a spell, open the spellbook and drag the relevant spell from the page onto the sheet.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
            <img src="./images/spell-drag.png" />
          </p>
          <p>
            Here we have memorized two spells, and selected one of those to be the single Level 1 Bonus spell, but clicking the radio button.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">

                To cast a spell, click on the magic wand icon. Bonus spells have a little "battery" icon that is either full or empty depending on
                whether it is memorized or not.<b>To rememorize a bonus spell, click on the empty battery icon to make a Temptation check and hopefully restore
                the spell.</b>

            When generated, the character's initial virtue is randomly rolled and set. Pascal's was set to 11...pretty average virtue. 
            If Pascal was of high virtue, he would not be able to memorize any spells!
          </p>
          <p>
            However, as the GM decides on actions throughout the session, they should then drop <em>Deeds</em> that represent the 
            relevant vice or virtue relating to that deed, which will affect Pascal's virtuous (or not) state.
          </p>
          <p>To do this, we can create a new <em>Deed</em> and fill in the details to represent the magnitude and detail of the act.</p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
            <img src="./images/sinful-deed.png" />
          </p>
          <p>When dragged onto the character sheet, this will then appear in the <em>Sins</em> column, and have an automatically negative effect on their virtue.</p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
            <img src="./images/deeds.png" />
          </p>
          <p>
            To atone for sins and recover virtue, as per the rules, click  on the dice icon by the Deeds header to randomly roll how many points of virtue are recovered.
          </p>
          <p>The largest sins will be automatically removed that can be, based on the roll.</p>

            Creating an NPC (classed or non-classed) is a similar process. Create a new <code>npc</code> actor type and you will be presented by an initial basic NPC.
          </p>
          <p>Here we have given them a name and set their level as per the rules for a Reisläufer - 2+1.</p>
          <div style="text-align: center;">
            <img src="./images/npc-gen-1.png" />
          </div>
          <p>As per the rules, you can add <code>*</code>'s to the level spec to denote increased threat, which will increase the calculated experience points, below.</p>
          <div style="text-align: center;">
            <img src="./images/npc-gen-2.png" />
          </div>
          <p>By default, the NPC is non-classed. Because we want out Reisläufer to be a weapons master, we need to assign the Fighter class to them. Simply open the Classes Compendium 
            and drag the Fighter entry onto the NPC sheet. This will recognise that a Fighter needs to specify a particular specialism, and prompt you to choose.
          </p>
          <div style="text-align: center;">
            <img src="./images/npc-gen-3.png" />
          </div>
          <hr>
          <h4 class="docs-header" id="npc-weapons">NPC Weapons & Skills</h4>
          <p>
            Once chosen, the Hit Dice will be set correctly, and other bonuses. Now we can give our Reisläufer some weapons. Rathern than bother with positions for NPCs, we assume everything is "worn" and so all weapons appear under Combat
            automatically. Either click the <code>+</code> sign next to the Combat heading to create a new weapon...
          </p>
          <div style="text-align: center;">
            <img src="./images/npc-gen-5a.png" />
          </div>
          <p>
            ...and edit it to create the weapon you. Here's we've created a Lucerne Hammer.
          </p>
          <div style="text-align: center;">
            <img src="./images/npc-gen-5b.png" />
          </div>
          <p> Alternatively, if a weapon already exists in the Compendium  (e.g. Halberd) then that can just be dragged onto the sheet. As you can see, the appropriate bonuses are applied automatically for all weapons.</p>
          <div style="text-align: center;">
            <img src="./images/npc-gen-6.png" />
          </div>
          <p>Finally, we can add any skills we need to our NPC. A Reisläufer apparently has the "Looting" craft skill, which isn't a normal craft skill in the Craft Compendium. It's a simple matter again to create
            a new Skill in the same way as we created a new Weapon, and give it whatever details we think necessary.
