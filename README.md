# Helveczia RPG for Foundry VTT

 This is an unofficial, third-party implementation of the excellent **Helvéczia** core rules, copyright **Gabor Lux**.

You need to get the [Helvéczia rules](https://emdt.bigcartel.com/category/helveczia-rpg)
in order to play. You will also find a wealth of inspiration for your games in the rules (and especially the excellent box set), too.
