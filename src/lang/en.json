The maximal number of spells someone can learn depends on the Cleric's level, while specific spells are tied to their places of origin: a humble chapel might only have one or two, while a cloister or cathedral could have many powerful ones. Once used, spells are lost, and need to be relearned. Only the rare relics of the saints allow someone to replenish a spell freely. Beginning characters start with a random spell selection.",

  "HV.cleric.healing": "If the Cleric does not fill his or her mind with spells, unused slots can be used for healing instead. The power of healing is 1d6, 2d6 or 3d6 Hp depending on the spell level. This power returns after Sunday mass. Spells which have already been learned cannot be converted to healing.",
  "HV.student.spells": "Secreted away in dark folios and manuscripts, Student spells must be committed to the mind with difficult methods, Latin formulae, and the study of goetic principles. Furthermore, spells require special material components, which need to be acquired and prepared with no small effort. Once used, spells are gone, and must be relearned; similarly, components are of finite use.",
  "HV.student.doctorate": "Students who reach sixth level may obtain a university doctorate by presenting and defending their scientific findings, at no small cost and effort. This is the source of significant prestige, but also has more tangible benefits. The character can distribute 6 extra points among Science skills (although a single skill can only be increased by 3), or learn a completely new Science. Furthermore, not only do they obtain 1d3+3 levels' worth of new spells in the process, but from now on, they can also devise spells of their own, which will bear their name till the end of the world.",

  "HV.vagabond.travellersLuck": "Due to Fortune's attentions, the character can add +2 to a saving throw or initiative roll 1d3 times in a single adventure.<p> The boon can be used before or after declaring the roll; <p>the 1d3 to establish Fortune's current generosity should be rolled on the first use."
