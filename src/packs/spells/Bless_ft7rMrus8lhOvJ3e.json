It would not do to list every possible effect of this spell, but it shall be noted that one of its most common applications is to extend luck to the departing congregation &ndash; who will receive +1 to all checks in the next predicament they encounter. Another use is invoked in battle, where it also grants +2 to damage, but only until the affair&rsquo;s conclusion.</p>"
