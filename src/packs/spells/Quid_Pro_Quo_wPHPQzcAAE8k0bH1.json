This saying is manifested by the Cleric spell that proves the saying by the inscrutable will of Providence. The lesson can come for a current or future deed; sudden action or well-planned scheme; but when it is meted out, it will come quickly, and everyone will see its morals. Those who perceive the spell&rsquo;s essence are unaffected, for they are not an honest soul &ndash; and woe to anyone who would abuse it for the benefit of themselves or their company!</p>"
