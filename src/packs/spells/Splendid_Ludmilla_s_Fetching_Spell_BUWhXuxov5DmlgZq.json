The subject will be there in half an hour, for unless they roll a successful Deftness save, a big, black, hairy beast will seize and carry them to the spot. It only works on someone the Student has known for a longer time, and can exactly remember, so it cannot be used for just anyone&rsquo;s harassment. It was made by Splendid Ludmilla, who was indeed very beautiful, but most bad-tempered.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Component: magical herbs must be cooked in a cauldron; and the animal, when it arrives, must be thrown a slab of salt, lest it becomes enraged.</p>"
