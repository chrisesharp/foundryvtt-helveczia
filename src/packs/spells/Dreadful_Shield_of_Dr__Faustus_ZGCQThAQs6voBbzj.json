It provides +4 AC, and while a hit above the increased rating causes regular damage, a hit falling on the shield will strike someone nearby, or within a quarter mile area at random. It takes seven strikes, and dissipates thereafter. It is a most terrible thing if it brings down the innocent, and who knows what consequences this will bring.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Component: the skulls of seven knaves are required, all undone by the headsman. Then, they must be placed at the points of a seven-pointed star made of Cordoban wax, wherein the magister must stand and carve himself a seal.</p>"
