But if this cock were to speak early, the plans might be unfinished &ndash; and so, this spell immediately calls the dawn&rsquo;s messenger, and with it sunrise. It is a real miracle, but should only be used by those who are sure of its usefulness: for every hour miraculously received, the Cleric must later sleep an entire week; and if the spell was used for an evil purpose, so many years.</p>"
