The Devil will help read the stars (+6 Astrology), and provide a deeper understanding of the important conjunctions. But let the one beware who would follow his advice: harm and treachery lies therein for the unwary.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Component: an astrological map (5 Th), but as the spell is used again and again, so do the constellations become more and more disordered, and the chance of a mistake higher and higher. It can be used two times as much as a regular component, but once consumed, the whole thing ignites and burns into ashes.</p>"
