The pitiful wreck can only cough and shuffle, since every exertion &ndash; fighting, running, riding a galloping horse, and so forth &ndash; requires a saving throw to avoid taking 1d3 damage, or 1d6 for greater physical efforts.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Component: it needs the lung of a corpse who had died of consumption; and a tincture, in which the student shall preserve it.</p>"
