Be it simple wood or gemstudded gold, it will suddenly become heavy like lead, and only seven strong men can move or lift its weight &ndash; but if an innocent with a Virtue of 21 would try, they will find it as light as a feather. The cross, if he or she is not the previous sort, even the Cleric may not again take up; a new one must be acquired, but until that time, they suffer a -2 against Temptation.</p>"
