This mindfulness does not apply to their company, unless the Cleric prevents the ruckus by approaching the beasts and calming them with ten minutes of preaching. And those animals such as those under the control of witches, spellcasters and other devil&rsquo;s companions are eligible to a saving throw. If the company would harm them, or threaten their little ones, this shall break the miracle as if it never were. This is common in the monasteries of the Franciscan brothers.</p>"
