At first level, this power is sufficient for a chair; at third, a table or multiple chairs; and at fifth, a great barrel, multiple tables, or all the chairs of a tavern (and according to their Analogy). Although their movement is inaccurate and not very fast, a quick movement of the hand, which dispels the magic or reduces its power by one degree, will make the objects ram their targets, against which a saving throw is applicable, and whose damage is variable (although rarely lethal).</p>"
