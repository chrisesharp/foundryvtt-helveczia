    "description": "<p class=\"p1\">A spell meant against beasts, unbelievers and devilry, it calls into being a two-handed mallet, which flies through the air by the character&rsquo;s commands. It can attack with the same skill as the Cleric, and cause very heavy wounds (1d10 plus Strength bonus). If the chosen foe is defeated, it can be sent to another, but it will not part from a selected target for any reason. It will not attack a Christian, but there is a 1:2 probability it will attack a Calvinist. It is said, the same has been experienced vice versa when encountering the deviltry of Calvinist preachers, who have no doubt reproduced the effects of this most holy instrument with the Devil&rsquo;s inspiration and tools.</p>"
