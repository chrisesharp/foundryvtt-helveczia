But the caster must beware lest he draw their ire, for only their patience is greater than their wrath; and if the question is foolish, or in opposition to their life&rsquo;s work, the dead may deny the answer or awaken. It does not work on those who have died in the Lord; which goes to show the great importance of taking one&rsquo;s extreme unction.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Component: a burial shroud, which has rested on the eyes of a doctor, and been sprinkled with consecrated oil after exhumation.</p>"
