But should it start with this spell, they will become very attentive, and will not leave until it is all finished &ndash; in fact, even more people will come to hear the preacher. Those who would leave must roll a saving throw; and as long as the sermon is ongoing, neither the preacher nor their companions will be harmed. There are not many who would thus collect the birds</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">and wild beasts around them to preach the Good Book, but the Franciscan brothers have done all that and more miraculous things.</p>"
