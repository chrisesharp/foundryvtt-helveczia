They receive a -4 to all rolls, and this curse lasts until someone regains the pentacle seal, and crushes it under a millstone. A Jewish foreman had once said that a miracle rabbi could solve the pentacle as a puzzle, and take it apart axe by axe, but who knows the truth of this claim.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Component: a pentacle seal, which must be made of a brass alloy, inlaid with golden axes, and decorated with intricate engravings for a total cost of 25 Th. It can be used multiple times, but it is only good for one curse at once, and only one may be carried.</p>"
