It is only afterwards that they realise the succulent viands were cowpies, the soup a muddy swill, the sweets horse crap, the fruits rotten mash, the Champagne wine &ndash; Heaven forfend! &ndash; horse piss, et cetera. Then, they must roll a Bravery save, or they will lie in sickbed for a week. Many have sought Tadeusz, but no matter how diligently they did, they could never find him.</p>"
