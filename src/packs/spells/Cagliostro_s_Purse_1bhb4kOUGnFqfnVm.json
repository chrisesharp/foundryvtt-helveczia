    "description": "<p class=\"p1\">It creates false gold coins, 1d6 in number, which look genuine until disappearing with the next cockcrow. One can reach into the purse a second time, but there is a 1:6 probability all coins disappear at once; on the third try, this chance is 1:3; and afterwards, 1:2. Those who keep the gold for long often believe they have lost it or been pickpocketed &ndash; but the earlier they lose it, the easier they become suspicious.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Component: a silk purse stuffed with fool&rsquo;s gold. It also works with goat&rsquo;s crap, but it shall remain behind in the mark&rsquo;s pocket or cashbox.</p>"
