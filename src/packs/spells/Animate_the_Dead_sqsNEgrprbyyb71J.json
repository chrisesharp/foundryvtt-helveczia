They will dig themselves out from below their mounds, and serve their caller as Skeletons (level 1) or Walking Corpses (level 2+1), numbering twice his levels. It can be used multiple times in succession, but if the unburied dead gather in large numbers in one place, a most evil resolve can arise among their ranks.</p>"
