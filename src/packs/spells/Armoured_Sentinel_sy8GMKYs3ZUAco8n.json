It is tireless, obedient, and a very worthy fighter, although it is not very quick, and its intellect is very modest. It may not stray far from its post. It fights as a level 6 Soldier, and its AC is equivalent to the suit.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Component: any old or new suit of heavy armour will suffice, but there is also a need for a lead pen, which must be prepared in copper sulphate, and with it, the sign of a heart must be inscribed on the armour. This pen, which embodies the spell&rsquo;s cost, may be used only once.</p>"
