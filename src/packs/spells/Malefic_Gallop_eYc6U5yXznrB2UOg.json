By the hour the time is up, the horse is bloated, foaming at the mouth, and it will expire among terrible contortions. There are some which survive it with a saving throw, but only the best, and even they must rest a week and be nursed with medicines. It might be cast on a man, but only the most debased might do such a thing, and they also get a Temptation save to avoid the effects.</p>"
