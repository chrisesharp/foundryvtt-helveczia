A circle must be drawn with the point of a yatagan, and until cockcrow, anyone who steps through the line will be cut into pieces by blades &ndash; i.e. they will receive one strike for every caster level, at the Student&rsquo;s fighting competency. The circle is visible as a ring of shiny steel, and it can be heard as the scraping sound of metal.</p>"
