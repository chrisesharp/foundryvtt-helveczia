    "description": "<p class=\"p1\">An instructive spell. It only affects those in a state of low Virtue, but it affects them most unpleasantly. As they swear, their words are twisted by the magic, and returned to torment them: e.g. if they say &ldquo;a pox on this house&rdquo;, then all within will suffer it, themselves included; and if they mention the Devil, he will surely pay a visit in short order. There is no way out from this catch until the victim does penance, and achieves average Virtue.</p>"
