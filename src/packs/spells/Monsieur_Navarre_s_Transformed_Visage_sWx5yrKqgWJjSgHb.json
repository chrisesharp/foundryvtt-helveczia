The next day, the target can make another save, unless prevented by sleep or worse fates.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Component: a silver sheet, prepared with rare acids and salts, and kept between black paper sheets, must be swiped between the two lit faces, causing them to appear on it, then it must be flipped very quickly.</p>"
