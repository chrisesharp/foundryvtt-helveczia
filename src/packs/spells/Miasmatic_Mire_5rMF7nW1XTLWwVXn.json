    "description": "<p class=\"p1\">Sin always leads the errant towards Hell, and this spell shows them the fastest way there is. If they fail their saving throws, they will sink into the ground as they are, everyone according to their sins: those with average Virtue to their ankles; those with low Virtue to their knees; and those with 3 or lower Virtue to their waist. From the first, someone may free themselves with a Hard Strength or Escape Artist check; from the second, they must dig for a quarter hour; and from the third, for some hours. It is useless on rocky ground.</p>"
