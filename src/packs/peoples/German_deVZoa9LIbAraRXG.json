Yet all Germans seek to learn the trade of one of their ancestors, and practice it with considerable skill.</p>\n<p>Due to their diligence, they learn an extra, randomly rolled Craft skill with a +2 bonus. In this trade, they are already considered journeymen by guild standards, and enjoy all attendant benefits.</p>\n<p>Germans can become masters in their craft at 4th level.</p>",
