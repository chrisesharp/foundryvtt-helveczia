This is the source of significant prestige, but also has more tangible benefits. The character can distribute 6 extra points among Science skills (although a single skill can only be increased by 3), or learn a completely new Science.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, not only do they obtain 1d3+3 levels' worth of new spells in the process, but from now on, they can also devise spells of their own, which will bear their name till the end of the world.</p>",
