The character can distribute 6 extra points among Science skills (although a single skill can only be increased by 3), or learn a completely new Science.</p>\n<p>Second, they will either be granted custody of a holy relic or an important ecclesiastic holding, and both benefits will also be accompanied&amp;nbsp;by 2d4*10 armed retainers.</p>",
